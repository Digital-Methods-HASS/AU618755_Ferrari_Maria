# About this Project (read me)

This GitHub repository contains my operation history for OpenRefine as well as a script for RStudio. The operation history is a text file in a JSON format. It can be applied to the Aarhus citizenship records from 1740 to 1862, which has been provided by Aarhus Stadsarkiv. To access original dataset please refer to the GitHub repository belonging to Aarhus Stadsarkiv: https://github.com/aarhusstadsarkiv/datasets/tree/master/citizenship/1740-1862.
